1.	Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.
-For Hean PHY, the problem that related to his app is layout. My ideas for this problem is that we can update the layout by redesign the user interface. We can focus on color patterns, fonts or the overall layouts such as how text view matches with image view. 
-For Khim SOK, he doesn’t like about the ads in the app. Since he is using a free version of the app, nothing could be done with that unless the developers want to contribute their software contribute public. My idea for this problem is that we should let the users understand and agree to the term and service that our software offers. Hence, the users might not compliant if the ads appears while using our app.
-For Muyyi LAY, her problem with her app is too much option to set before she is able to set her to-do-list. My idea for this problem will be redesigning the app in user-friendly way. For example, consider making the app easy to use by eliminating unnecessary functionalities of the app while keeping the app runs properly. 
-For Sarran KONG, his problem is also similar to Muyyi’s. The app is not user-friendly and too confused to use. My idea for his problem is that improving the app quality by updating the user-interface and its functionalities. Hence, users will quickly understand how to use the app smoothly. 
-For Cheat SOK, her problem is that she needs to upgrade the app for use full version of the app. My idea for this problem is that app developer could offer optional deal to their users by allowing the users to use their app for free for certain period of time before asking the users to update to full-version.
2.	Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.
In my opinion, this problem could be solved by given free app to user for period of time before charging the users. I believe that this solution would hugely reduce the conflict between user and developers. In addition, the developers should state in their app about the efforts which they put into making their quality apps. On top of that, the users should understand that apps which they download is similar to items they purchase at stores. The users need to spend money to buy these items. Therefore, if the users like the app , they should support the developers by purchasing the app.  
3.	Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.
The best UI/UX app which I come across is Instagram App. What I find it to be so good is about the overall layout of the app. Its layout is so organized and the functionalities of the app is relatively easy to use. In addition,  the app allows the users to scroll to from one image to another image smoothly. The content of every user such as their photo are perfectly separates. Moreover, the app also has the chat function which allows users communicate with each other constantly. All in all, this app has presented the complex photo sharing platform into sample, user-friendly manner.
4.	Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss briefly.
The items number 1 to 3 did give me some ideas about the users’ desire on the app and possible issues from the app they use. I would pursue a free app as a project this course. Hence, the user will benefit from the app that I create. I plan to create charity event app, which will provide all information about nearby charity events to user.
